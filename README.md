## Summary

This will be a [complete](#complete) catalogue of all spoke patterns
to [length N](#pattern-names).  There is no guarantee of [safety or
practicality](#safety-and-practicality) - in fact, **some patterns are
unsafe and impractical**.

## Notes

### Pattern Names

To write this software and organise the results into the catalogue
above I have had to invent some terms.  My apologies if these are
confusing, or replace / conflict with existing usage.

#### Spoke Offsets

#### Pattern Groups

I describe spoke patterns in three groups:

* **Group A**: Patterns where 

#### Canonical Names

### Rim Compatability

A pattern of length N can be used in any wheel with a multiple of 2N
spoke holes, providing the crosses are possible.  So a pattern of
length 3 (like Crow's Foot) can be used with 36 hole rims, and a
pattern of length 2 (like 3 Cross) can be used with pretty much any
rim as long as the hub can accomodate the spoke angles.

### Safety And Practicality

The patterns shown here are generated by a computer program that
considers every possible combination **without considering how safe
or practical the design may be**.

Safe, practical spoke designs distribute forces (from tension,
acceleration, braking and collisions) evenly around the rim.  The
appropriate choice of pattern for a wheel will depend on many
different factors and **should be made by an expert wheelbuilder**.

### Completeness

This catalogue is restricted to:

* A single wheel side.  The illustrations show spokes at both sides of
  the wheel, but I do not consider different relative offsets of the
  two sides, or even using a different pattern on each side.

* Straight spokes.  I have not included "snowflake" patterns and
  other, similar designs where spokes are wrapped around each other.

* Completely spoked wheels.  I have not considered gaps / missing
  spokes.

* Patterns of length N (or less).
