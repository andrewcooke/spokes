## Summary

This will be a [complete](#complete) catalogue of all spoke patterns
to [length N](#pattern-names).  There is no guarantee of [safety or
practicality](#safety-and-practicality) - in fact, **some patterns are
unsafe and impractical**.

## Notes

### Pattern Names

### Rim Compatability

A pattern of length N can be used in any wheel with a multiple of 2N
spoke holes, providing the crosses are possible).  So a pattern of
length 3 (like Crow's Foot) can be used with 36 hole rims, and a
pattern of length 2 (like 3 Cross) can be used with pretty much any
rim as long as the hub can accomodate the spoke angles.
