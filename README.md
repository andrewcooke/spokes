## Summary

This will be a [complete](#complete) catalogue of all spoke patterns
to [length N](#pattern-names).  There is no guarantee of [safety or
practicality](#safety-and-practicality) - in fact, **some patterns are
unsafe or impractical**.

## Notes

### Pattern Names

To write this software and organise the results into the catalogue
above I have had to invent some terms.  My apologies if these are
confusing, or replace / conflict with existing usage.

#### Spoke Offsets

We can describe spokes as 

#### Pattern Groups

I describe spoke patterns in three groups:

* **Group A**: Patterns where 

#### Pattern Lengths



#### Preferred Names

Many patterns can have more than one name.  For example, you could
describe a traditional 3 Cross pattern as "3A", "3B0", "3,-3C" or even
"3,-3,3,-3C" etc.  To avoid duplication I always favour the
description that has the least number of offsets listed, with A
preferred over B.  This means that there are no "B0" patterns (since
those are all "A").

Similarly, lists of spoke offsets should be rotated so that small (but
non-negative) values occur first (more exactly, a lexical sorting
based on numerical values, but where negative values come later; more
exactly still, please see the code).

### Rim Compatability

A pattern of length N can be used in any wheel with a multiple of 2N
spoke holes, providing the crosses are possible.  So a pattern of
length 3 (like Crow's Foot) can be used with 36 hole rims, and a
pattern of length 2 (like 3 Cross) can be used with pretty much any
rim as long as the hub can accomodate the spoke angles.

### Safety And Practicality

The patterns shown here are generated by a computer program that
considers every possible combination **without considering how safe
or practical the design may be**.

Safe, practical spoke designs distribute forces (from tension,
acceleration, braking and collisions) evenly around the rim.  The
appropriate choice of pattern for a wheel will depend on many
different factors and **should be made by an expert wheelbuilder**.

One practical issue I would like to describe in more detail is
unbalanced rotation.  For example, a radially spoked wheel is "the
same" as one where all the spokes are offset by one hole - when you
actually build the wheel with offset spokes (ignoring problems with
spoke length) the spokes would tighten until they were radial.

So, to be included in the catalogue, patterns which have spokes offset
in one direction must also have at least one spoke offset in the
opposite direction.  This excludes the most obvious problems but still
allows patterns where rotational forces in the two directions are
carried by different numbers of spokes (because these patterns are not
symmetrical they are all group C).

### Completeness

This catalogue is restricted to:

* A single wheel side.  The illustrations show spokes at both sides of
  the wheel, but I do not consider different relative offsets of the
  two sides, or even using a different pattern on each side.

* Straight spokes.  I have not included "snowflake" patterns and
  other, similar designs where spokes are wrapped around each other.

* Completely spoked wheels.  I have not considered gaps / missing
  spokes.

* Spoke offsets of 4 (or less).

* Patterns of length N (or less).

Apart from these limitations, the catalogue should be complete as it
is generated by a computer program that searches for all
possibilities.  If you find a pattern that is missing please contact
me as it may mean I have a bug in my program!
